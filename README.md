##Task
The requirements
We want a 100% responsive version
Meaning that we should not have a HTML version for desktop and another one for mobile.

Links
The whole block should link to the page of the partner directly.
However, the icon and the text “Read Review” should link to the review page (given that this is just a test, just make sure the link is independent from the one on the whole box).
To summarise, you should have at most 3 links: one for the whole box, one on the icon and one on the “Read Review” text.

SEO requirements
Our SEO team has sometimes to provide guidelines because it can impact the rankings, especially regarding the internal linking.
In this test, SEO has one requirement: the icon of the sportsbooks (Bet365, William Hill, Bodog… etc) should be a link and should have an anchor. This anchor shouldn’t be visible to the users.

Mouseover animations
When the user puts his mouse over the boxe, the box size should increase of 10% to make it more appealing.

Toggle animations
As described in the design, when toggling the button (that appears above of the table), it should change the design from a inline list to a card box. Ideally, we would like to have a smooth animation to make it pleasant for our users.

Filter “Sort Alphabetically"
As you can see on the top left, there is an anchor called “Sort Alphabetically”.
This should sort the list of partners by their name (Sports Interaction, PowerPlay, Betway, SpinSports, Bodog).

Front-end framework
Using React or not is up to you, this is not a requirement.
If you do, please use HTML or JSX.
Angular technology shouldn’t be used in this test.

CSS framework
You’re free to use raw CSS, Less, Sass, etc… this is totally up to you.

JS framework
If you have to use JavaScript, you can either use raw JS (no framework) or jQuery.
